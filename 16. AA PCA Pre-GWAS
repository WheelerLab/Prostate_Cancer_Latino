#Before moving on, steps with PC Covariates need to be done

#NOTE: These files were found in /home/mohammed/px_prostate_cancer_AA NOT in the AAnew directory
#PCA can be run with these files - however I contacted Mohammed to make sure they are still viable to use.

#Run PCA in Plink rather than use smartPCA
    #First, get LD Pruned data from previous QC runs. In this case, these files were found in /home/mohammed/px_prostate_cancer_AA/
    #The files QC6d1 were taken from his directory 
    NOTE: this directory was clarified by Mohammed as safe to use for QC files - just not for Imputing data
    
        jack@wheelerlab1:/home/mohammed/px_prostate_cancer_AA$ cp QC6d1.b* /home/jack/Mohammed_files/AA/My_QC_files/
        jack@wheelerlab1:/home/mohammed/px_prostate_cancer_AA$ cp QC6d1.fam /home/jack/Mohammed_files/AA/My_QC_files/

    #The next step in QC was to prune the data, so I did just that:
        jack@wheelerlab1:~/Mohammed_files/AA/My_QC_files$ plink --bfile QC6d1 --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.3 --recode --out QC7
        
    #Then I made my bfiles:
        jack@wheelerlab1:~/Mohammed_files/AA/My_QC_files$ plink --bfile QC6d1 --make-bed --out QC7
    
    #Run the PCA
        jack@wheelerlab1:~/Mohammed_files/AA/My_QC_files$ plink --bfile QC7 --pca 10 header --out /home/jack/Mohammed_files/AA/Post-PCA/PCA
    
        jack@wheelerlab1:~/Mohammed_files/AA/Post-PCA$ ls
            PCA.eigenval  PCA.eigenvec  PCA.log
        #Now we have the eigenvec file for GWAS!
