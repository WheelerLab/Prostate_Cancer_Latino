#Since the rel-cutoff histogram showed a few outliers above 0.05, we have to sort the genome file (QC5b2.genome) in descending order of the column "PI_HAT"
#Command used: "sort -n -k10,10r QC5b2.genome"
  #This sorts the file I want "QC5b2.genome", in descending order of the 10th column
  #For other use, just switch out the 10s with any column number and insert filename at the end
  #Caution: It starts sorting the file rapidly in terminal for a minute or 2
  #So the file tells us that there are:

* If you believe this is due to strand inconsistency, try --flip with

  (Warning: if this seems to work, strand errors involving SNPs with A/T or C/G
  alleles probably remain in your data.  If LD between nearby SNPs is high,
  --flip-scan should detect them.)
* If you are dealing with genuine multiallelic variants, we recommend exporting
  that subset of the data to VCF (via e.g. '--recode vcf'), merging with
  another tool/script, and then importing the result; PLINK is not yet suited
  to handling them.
