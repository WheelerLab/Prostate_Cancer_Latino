#Make sure you keep track of how many SNPs are in the current dosages files – you will need to keep track of how many are filtered out once the Python script is run
#Path to Lauren’s python script. Copy to directory where Imputed dosage.vcf.gz files are.

#Running the UMich Python Script:
#Using a simple bash command with 22 lines of input doesn’t seem to work.
#Create for loop bash command to run the Python script for each chromosome.

#-r may be CAPPA depending on the population
#-m defaults MAF to .01 (this can be deleted if .01 is wanted)
#-r2 defaults to .08 (this can be deleted if .08 is wanted)

#Run a nohup bash command to have the script work in the background.
#Check to make sure chr1 (or whichever is first) is within the new UMich_dosages directory, and it should be going.

#Once I had one chromosome to test, I tried converting it to a bed file.
#Converts dosage txt.gz file to .bed
	zcat file.txt.gz | sed 's/:/\t/g' | sed 's/-/\t/g' > file.bed
#Above step incorrect, file formed from this command was deleted
#I need to use vcftools to filter .dose.vcf.gz files downloaded from Michigan Imputation by MAF of .01 and r^2 of 0.8
#vcftools.sourceforge.net has good vcftools commands for allele implementations

#Could not find how to filter MAF and r^2 with vcftools, so converted to plink and then I will filter
#To filter by MAF 0.01:
plink --bfile chr_# --maf 0.01 –-make-bed –-out chr_#
#***Note***: If the same filename is used for the out file in this step, the unfiltered input file will now have a ~ at the end of it. Delete the ~input files, keep the new ones.

#To filter by r^2 0.8:
plink --bfile chr_# --r2 0.8 –-make-bed –-out chr_#
#Error invalid --r/--r2 parameter ‘0.8’ 
#Lauren sent: --qual-threshold 0.8 to use, might be better suited for this

#Found Aly’s old post Imputation filtering and conversion. Steps 2 and 4 (disregard HW equilibrium part) will be used for MAF and r^2 filtering: https://github.com/abadalamenti1/Population_Expression_Prediction/blob/ef5160cbe7e1c5bdb613acf48b30dbba0ca4bcb7/B)_Steps_After_Imputation 
#2) Obtain the imputation output files using the emailed encription key, and remove SNPs with R2 < 0.8. Make sure these files are gzipped.
nano R^2_Aly’s Format:
‘for i in {1..22}; 
do bcftools filter -i 'R2>0.8' chr${i}.dose.vcf.gz > POP_chr${i}.R20.8.dose.vcf; 
done’

#4) QC on merged files using vcftools, keeping only SNPs with MAF > 0.01
'for i in {1..22};
do vcftools --gzvcf POP_merge_chr${i}.R20.8.dose.vcf.gz --maf 0.01 --recode --out POP_filtered_chr${i}; 
done'
#Output for each chromosome: POP_filtered_chr#.recode.vcf

#To convert to bed bim fam format:
plink –-vcf POP_filtered_chr#.recode.vcf –out POP_filtered_chr#
#Output for each chromosome: POP_filtered_chr#.bed
#Output for each chromosome: POP_filtered_chr#.bim
#Output for each chromosome: POP_filtered_chr#.fam
