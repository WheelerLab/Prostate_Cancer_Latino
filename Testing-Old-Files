Testing-Old-Files

#This repo is strictly for figuring out why my GWAS is not working
#I will be pulling SNPs from original Plink files and comparing them to both pre-PC files and post-GWAS files
#Let's start by finding the old files

#In /home/jack/

#This makes 2 files, J.txt and L.txt, in which J.txt has all rows with J in column 4
#We have 2263 Japanese and 2206 Latino people in our cohort
  wc -l J.txt 
    2263 J.txt
  wc -l L.txt 
    2206 L.txt

#Now we have to make the files into bed/bim/fam files. 
#Problem is that the rows in L.txt and J.txt have different number of columns, so copy the first 4 columns (important ones) to another file. 
  awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$4}' L.txt > LA.txt
  awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$4}' J.txt > JA.txt
    #So the 2 new files have the important first 4 columns from the original 2 files.
