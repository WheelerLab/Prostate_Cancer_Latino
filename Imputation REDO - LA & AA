Imputation REDO - LA & AA
11/16/17

#The problem at hand was for Imputation - files pruned for LD plots were used to further process QC rather than skip around this step for QC. 
#To fix this, we have to go back to the step in QC before LD pruning and continue from there so that the uploaded Michigan files will have all the SNPs
#I made a new directory called ImpREDO for the new steps to get from Step QC4 to Imputation

#Copy the QC2 files used before LD pruning into the new directory
jack@wheelerlab1:~$ cd px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO
jack@wheelerlab1:~/px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO$ cp /home/jack/px_prostate_cancer_LA/QC2* .

#Jump from steps for QC2 to Liftover - using QC2 files to covert to hg19 (do not do QC3 onward)
