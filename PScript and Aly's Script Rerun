#I will be rerunning the python script (PrediXcan Format) and Aly's script (Plink format) for post-imp files
#Both will output files that should be filtered by MAF and r^2
#Have to be sure the SNP count remains the same for each once finished

  #Making new directory for PScript files and Aly's Script files
