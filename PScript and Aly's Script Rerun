#For both the LA and JA cohorts:
#I will be rerunning the python script (PrediXcan Format) and Aly's script (Plink format) for post-imp files
#Both will output files that should be filtered by MAF and r^2
#Have to be sure the SNP count remains the same for each once finished

  #Making new directory for PScript files and Aly's Script files for LA:
  ~/px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO/Imputed_files$ mkdir Post-PScript
  ~/px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO/Imputed_files$ mkdir Post-MAF-Aly
  ~/px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO/Imputed_files$ mkdir Post-R2-Aly
  
  #Similarly for JA:
  ~/Mohammed_files/JA$ mkdir Post_Imp_Filtering_2
    
  
  
  #First I am running the PScript which outputs to "~/px_prostate_cancer_LA/ImpREDO/Imputed_files/UMich_dosages"
  
      nohup bash Loop_For_Running_PScript
      
  #Then I ran files for R^2
      nohup bash R^2_Alys_Format
      
  #Then I ran files for MAF
      nohup bash MAF_Aly's_Format

#LA:
  #PScript filter complete
  #R2 complete, need to gzip the output files before they can go through MAF filter
  #MAF will be run once finished gzipping
  
#JA:
  #Running Pscript currently
  #R2 and MAF finished
