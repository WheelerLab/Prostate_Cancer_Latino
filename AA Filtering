#Continuing Mohammed's work on the African American cohort
#Due to discrepancies between chromosomes that have been successfully filtered and some that have not, I am going to start with .dose files and filter r^2 and MAF from there

#Copying all the .dose files from Mohammed's directory to my own
    /home/mohammed/px_prostate_cancer_AAnew$ cp chr*.dose.vcf.gz /home/jack/Mohammed_files/AA/

#Currently what is in the African American files:
#jack@wheelerlab1:~/Mohammed_files/AA$ ls
    AA_Phenotype       chr14.dose.vcf.gz  chr19.dose.vcf.gz  chr2.dose.vcf.gz  chr7.dose.vcf.gz
    chr10.dose.vcf.gz  chr15.dose.vcf.gz  chr1.dose.vcf.gz   chr3.dose.vcf.gz  chr8.dose.vcf.gz
    chr11.dose.vcf.gz  chr16.dose.vcf.gz  chr20.dose.vcf.gz  chr4.dose.vcf.gz  chr9.dose.vcf.gz
    chr12.dose.vcf.gz  chr17.dose.vcf.gz  chr21.dose.vcf.gz  chr5.dose.vcf.gz  MAF_Ally'sFormat
    chr13.dose.vcf.gz  chr18.dose.vcf.gz  chr22.dose.vcf.gz  chr6.dose.vcf.gz  R^2_Ally'sFormat
    
#Using R^2 script to filter:
    nohup bash R^2_Ally'sFormat &
    #Should output POP_chr#.R20.8.dose.vcf files
